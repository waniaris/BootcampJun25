# The Terminal

## Challenge

Your challenge is to create a new root folder for all your projects called `bootcamp`. Inside this folder, create a subfolder named `Week 1`. Finally, within the `Week 1` folder, create a new file called `readme.md`.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand what the Terminal is and how to interact with it.
- Learn to navigate the file system using basic Terminal commands.
- Practice creating directories and files from the command line.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to organize my projects efficiently using the Terminal so that I can easily manage and access them as I progress through the bootcamp.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A folder named `bootcamp` is created in your root directory.
- Inside the `bootcamp` folder, there is a subfolder named `Week 1`.
- Inside the `Week 1` folder, there is a file named `readme.md`.
- The file system structure should look like this:
- You should be able to traverse to the `bootcamp` folder from any location in the Terminal using basic navigation commands.
- You should be able to create directories and files using Terminal commands.

## Steps to Complete

1. **Open the Terminal**: Familiarize yourself with the Terminal interface.
2. **Navigate to the root directory**: Use the `cd` (change directory) command to ensure you are in the root directory.
3. **Create the `bootcamp` folder**: Use the `mkdir` (make directory) command to create a new directory called `bootcamp`.
4. **Navigate into the `bootcamp` folder**: Use `cd bootcamp` to enter the newly created directory.
5. **Create the `Week 1` folder**: Inside `bootcamp`, create a new directory named `Week 1`.
6. **Navigate into the `Week 1` folder**: Use `cd Week 1` to enter the `Week 1` directory.
7. **Create the `readme.md` file**: Use the `touch` command to create a new file called `readme.md`.
8. **Verify the structure**: Use the `ls` command to list the contents of the directories and confirm that the file structure is correct.
