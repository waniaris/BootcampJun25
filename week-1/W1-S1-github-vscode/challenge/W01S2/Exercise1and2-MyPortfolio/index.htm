    <h3>My Brief Bio:</h3>
    <p>I am currently working in the secondary education industry, working closely with the senior leadership and the pastoral team
        to monitor, promote and maintain high levels of student attendance across the school as a means of ensuring safeguarding 
        and high levels of student achievement and a commitment to inclusive education.</p>

    <p>Instilling a culture of high expectations for all students across the school, I am leveraging on my experience as a trainer
        and the domain expert in Performance Management portfolio, adapting to the 'no two days are the same' environment with 
        young people as the focus group and main stakeholder.</p>
