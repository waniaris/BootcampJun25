# Exercise: Using VSCode with GitHub

## Challenge

In this exercise, you will modify a `README.md` file in your local repository using VSCode, stage the changes, commit them, and push them to your remote GitHub repository. This exercise is designed to help you get comfortable with using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) alongside GitHub.

## Key Learnings

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

- Open and edit files in VSCode.
- Use VSCode’s built-in Git integration to stage and commit changes.
- Push your changes to a remote GitHub repository from VSCode.
- Confirm that your changes have been successfully applied on GitHub.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to make changes to the `README.md` file in my local repository using VSCode, and push these changes to my remote GitHub repository, so that I can manage my codebase efficiently from my IDE.

## Steps to Complete the Challenge

1. Open the local repository in VSCode.
2. Modify the `README.md` file by adding a short description of your project (e.g., “This is a sample project for learning how to use VSCode with GitHub”).
3. Stage your changes using VSCode’s Git panel.
4. Commit your changes with a meaningful message (e.g., “Updated README with project description”).
5. Push your commit to the remote repository on GitHub.
6. Verify the change by checking the `README.md` file on your GitHub repository.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The `README.md` file must be modified locally using VSCode.
2. The change must be successfully staged and committed using VSCode’s Git integration.
3. The commit must be pushed to the remote GitHub repository.
4. The changes must be visible on GitHub by viewing the updated `README.md` file in the remote repository.

Good luck, and happy coding!
