# Create Your First Web Page

## Challenge

Your challenge is to create a simple portfolio web page that includes your name, contact details, a short bio, a hyperlink to your email address, and a picture of yourself. This exercise will help you get familiar with the basics of web development, including HTML markup tags and attributes.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

- The basic structure of an HTML document.
- How to use HTML tags to create and organize content on a web page.
- The purpose and usage of common HTML attributes.
- How to include images and hyperlinks in your web page.

## User Story

As a new web developer, I want to create a simple portfolio page that includes my name, contact information, a brief bio, and a picture of myself so that I can share my contact details and introduce myself online.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The web page should have a proper HTML structure, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- The page should display your name prominently at the top using an appropriate heading tag (e.g., `<h1>`).
- Contact details should include at least an email address and should be formatted using appropriate HTML tags (e.g., `<p>` for a paragraph, `<a>` for a hyperlink).
- There should be a hyperlink to your email address using the `mailto:` attribute within the `<a>` tag.
- The page should include a short bio about yourself, organized in a paragraph.
- An image of yourself should be displayed on the page using the `<img>` tag with the `src` attribute pointing to your image file.
- Ensure that the image has an appropriate `alt` attribute describing the picture.
- The web page should be structured using semantic HTML tags, where appropriate.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have a text editor (like VSCode, Sublime Text, or Notepad++) and a web browser installed.
2. **Create the HTML file**: Create a new file named `index.html`.
3. **Build the basic structure**: Add the HTML boilerplate code (`doctype`, `html`, `head`, `body`).
4. **Add content**: Start by adding your name, contact details, bio, and image as specified in the acceptance criteria.
5. **Save and view**: Save your file and open it in your web browser to see your portfolio page.

## Tips

- Remember to test your page in different web browsers to ensure compatibility.
- Make sure your HTML is well-structured and easy to read by using proper indentation and spacing.

## Submission

Once you've completed the exercise, submit your `index.html` file and any image file used in the project to your instructor.
